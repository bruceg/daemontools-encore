.TH fifo 8
.SH NAME
fifo \- create and read a named pipe while writing to child.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fifo
.I file
.I child
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fifo
prints everything fed to the named pipe
.I file
to standard input
of
.IR child .
.I file
is held open for writing so that other programs
can repeatedly open and close
.IR file .
The pipe to
.I child
is held open
for reading so
.I child
can be restarted if it dies without losing data.

.B fifo
creates
.I file
if
.I file
does not exist.

At startup,
.B fifo
prints a banner message ("fifostart") to
.I child
to ensure it is running before reading from
.IR file .

If your platform supports the FIONREAD ioctl,
.I fifo
will wait until
the banner has been read before reading from
.IR file .
In that case, if
.I child
dies before the banner is read
.B fifo
exits without reading
from
.I file
and prints a message on standard error.

.B fifo
tries to restart
.I child
if it stops. It never gives up.

.B fifo
normally runs forever.

At shutdown (SIGTERM),
.B fifo
reads from
.I file
until the next
newline. If the last character read was already a newline,
.B fifo
stops
reading immediately. If
.B fifo
doesn't see a newline within 2 seconds,
it gives up.

.B fifo
waits until its buffers have been flushed before shutting down.

If your platform supports FIONREAD,
.B fifo
waits until the pipe to
.I child
has been completely read before closing it.
.SH EXIT CODES
.B fifo
normally exits 0 after SIGTERM and
.I child
stops.

.B fifo
exits 100 for improper usage with a message on standard error.

For any other problems,
.B fifo
exits 111 with a message on standard
error.
.SH SIGNALS

.Sp
.RS 4
.B fifo
stops reading from
.IR file ,
empties its buffer, and closes pipe
to
.IR child .
.I child
is expected to continue until it notices end of
input and exit gracefully.
.B fifo
then stops.
