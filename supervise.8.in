.TH supervise 8
.SH NAME
supervise \- starts and monitors a service.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B supervise
.I s
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B supervise
switches to the directory named
.I s
and starts the service there by executing first
.B ./start
(if it is executable), and then
.BR ./run ,
if it exists.
It restarts
.B ./run
if
.B ./start
exits zero or
.B ./run
exits with any value other than 100.
It pauses for a second after starting
.BR ./run ,
so that it does not loop
too quickly if
.B ./run
exits immediately.
After
.B ./run
exits for the last time (ie after
.B svc -d
has been issued), it runs
.B ./stop
once.

Unless the file
.B ./no-setsid
exists,
.B supervise
will run subordinate processes in a new process group.

If
.B ./log
is an executable file,
.B supervise
starts it before any of the above, and will restart it if it exits.
Standard output from the main script
will be redirected through a pipe to standard input of the log process.
As a special case, if
.B svc -dx
is issued, the log will be stopped after the main service has stopped.

If the file
.IB s /down
exists,
.B supervise
does not start the service immediately. You can use
.BR svc (8)
to start the service and to give other commands to
.BR supervise .

If the file
.IB s /notify
exists and is executable,
.B supervise
executes it when any script starts or stops.  It is given four
command-line arguments: The first is the name of the script being
executed, one of
.BR start ,
.BR run ,
.BR stop ,
or
.BR log .
The second is a status code, one of:
.TP
.B start
The script started executing.
.TP
.B exit
The running script exited.
.TP
.B killed
The running script was killed by a signal.
.P
The third is the process ID of the newly created or just exited process.
The fourth is the exit code or kill signal number, or
.B 0
on start.

If the file
.IB s /orphanage
exists,
.B supervise
will wait until all ancestors of the supervised process have also exited,
before it will consider the process stopped. In the meantime, the process
is considered to be in an "orphanage" state.

.B supervise
maintains status information in a binary format inside the directory
.IR s\fB/supervise ,
which must be writable to
.BR supervise .
The status information can be read by
.BR svstat (8).

.B supervise
may exit immediately after startup if it cannot find the files it needs in
.I s
or if another copy of
.B supervise
is already running in
.IR s .
Once
.B supervise
is successfully running, it will not exit unless it is killed or specifically
asked to exit. You can use
.BR svok (8)
to check whether
.B supervise
is successfully running and
.BR svup (8)
to check if the supervised process is running. You can use
.BR svscan (8)
to reliably start a collection of
.B supervise
processes. 
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B SUPERVISEDIR
If set, the named directory is used instead of
.B @SUPERVISEDIR@
for the status information and control files.  If
.B $SUPERVISEDIR
is an absolute path, it is suffixed with the path to
.I s
with all slashes ("/") replaced with colons (":").
